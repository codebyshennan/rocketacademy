## Bootcamp @ Rocket Academy

I attended a six-month bootcamp as part of my personal career transition from the military to tech. Having dabbled in tech on-and-off (I spent a decade in Robotics, a year in Computer Science in NUS), I've decided that software would be my next venture as I moved into my thirties.

I tried to base these projects off some real-life problems that I faced, my friends faced, or might potentially face in the future, and wrapped it around the relevant content that was taught at that specific time period. Most of these projects were done as a pair to induce collaborative software development and ensure that we could ship a workable product, from ideation to presentation, within two weeks. 

This serves as a reminder of how far I've come since venturing into this career path on Jul 21, and most of the deployed links have expired ever since Heroku removed the free tier in 2022. The emphasis here is on the thought process of software development and how I've / we've improved over the months of the bootcamp. There are some projects that were not even completed due to time constraints and over-complexity (at the time), but served as a testbed for integrating some of the more advanced concepts that were not even taught in the bootcamp (like PubSub models and real-time chat functions).

It was a very arduous six-months of non-stop learning, and I would do it all over again!
